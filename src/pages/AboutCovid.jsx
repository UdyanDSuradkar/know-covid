      <h1>About COVID-19</h1>
      <p>
        COVID-19 is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus. It
        primarily spreads through respiratory droplets and can cause mild to
        severe illness.
      </p>

      <h2>How it Spreads</h2>
      <p>
        The virus spreads mainly through close contact with an infected person
        via respiratory droplets, and sometimes through surfaces that have the
        virus on them.
      </p>

      <h2>Protect Yourself</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Wash your hands regularly</li>
        <li>Maintain social distancing</li>
        <li>Wear a mask</li>
        <li>Avoid crowded places</li>
        <li>Stay informed from reliable sources</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
